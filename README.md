## ðŸ§ª Notes

- This is experimental software â€” fork it, break it, improve it.
- Pull requests are welcome!
- The system has been tested with webcam input and iPhone 12 streams via software like [Camo Studio](https://reincubate.com/camo/).
- Iâ€™m a recreational developer. This project is unlikely to receive continued updates, but you're welcome to extend it or explore [my other repos](https://github.com/Ronnie-Reagan?tab=repositories).
